If you are reading this, then congratulations! Your optical sensors are working perfectly.

Unmodified, the TESI Storage Tank works as follows:

    1. By default, the root prim is a cylinder that represents the actual liquid inside the tank. As long as it stays a cylinder, any changes to its size will correctly reflect the capacity of the tank. You can, of course, change it!
    2. Communications occur over the LC protocol on channel -9999969.
    3. Documentation for the LC protocol can be found at http://develop.nanite-systems.com/?id=1924
    4. Interaction can be accomplished through the menus or by using another TESI device.

If you would like to modify the Storage Tank script:

    1. Make sure you have your development environment set up properly, first.
        a. You must be using Firestorm.
        b. In Preferences â€º Build 1, enable the following options:
            i. LSL preprocesor
            ii. Script optimizer
            iii. #includes from local disk
            (The other options are not required.)
        c. Set your preprocessor include path to a location of your choice, and download the following files into it:
            i. http://develop.nanite-systems.com/includes/utils.lsl
            ii. http://develop.nanite-systems.com/includes/objects.lsl
            (You may want to peruse http://develop.nanite-systems.com/includes/ for other NS-related header files.)
    2. To modify the shape or appearance of the container:
        a. The capacity_formula(size) macro on line 4 defines the cylindroidal volume of the shape.
        b. Line 7 has an alternative for a cuboid.
        c. To set a fixed volume that disregards shape, see line 10.
        d. Unlink prim 1 from the other included prims. Link it to whatever tank appearance you want.
        e. Prim 1 will always have its slice attribute set to match its current fill level.
            If you switch to using a fixed volume, it may make a good meter. But it does need to stay as prim 1.
        f. Retexture it! Make it pretty! The default materials are really just placeholders.
    3. Feel free to sell your modifications to the tank.
        a. Make sure you follow the guide at http://wiki.nanite-systems.com/?id=2496 to avoid brand confusion.

That's all! Enjoy your robotic goo.
