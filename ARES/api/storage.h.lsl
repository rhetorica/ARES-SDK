/*
	file stat in ARES 0.4.4

	When a file is opened, _storage will send the following fields to your application via a notify "<program> file" pipe:
   
	  <size> <unit> <type> <description>   

	The fields are space-separated and have the following definitions:
		<size> is the length of the file, measured in <unit>.
		<unit> is b for bytes, p for pages, or l for lines.
		<type> is d for directory, o for unreadable objects, and f for readable text files.
		<description> is a freeform string (e.g. llGetInventoryDesc()) and may not be present.
	
	Attempting to read an object file will cause an error. (These were added to represent SL inventory items with no interpretable contents.) Attempting to read a directory will give a linebreak-separated list of names therein. The special file "<source>:*" will list all files in <source>, e.g. "local:*".
	
	The "<source>:" prefix can also be used to disambiguate files with identical names, but finding them in the first place may be nontrivial; the behavior of fs:root when multiple files with the same name are present in different sources is currently undefined and will generally cause problems.
*/

/*
    file read in ARES 0.4.4
	
	Once the file is opened and you have received its stat values (above), you can then ask _storage to start sending data. To successfully iterate through a file, you need to look at the unit and then request appropriate sections with file_read().
	
	The offset parameter of file_read() may be a single number or <start> <length> (with a " " in the middle). If no <length> is missing, then only 1 unit will be returned. If your application can handle it, you should simply request the entire file using the <size> given by the file_open() macro.
	
	If the <unit> is b, then you will only get one byte at a time if you fail to specify <length>, which is not very useful. Instead use a larger window, like 1024 or 2048, and iterate over the file to the best of your program's memory-handling abilities.
	
	If you request data from an "l" file, a linebreak will always be added on the end so that the text can be concatenated properly without worrying about the underlying format.
