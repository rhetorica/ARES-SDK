/*
	LSD DATABASE I/O

	Read, write, and delete database entries.
	
	There are two sets of macros for interacting with the Linkset datastore. The first set has names ending in 'dbl', and the second set has names ending in 'db'.
	
	The 'dbl' macros assume the key name is already split into a list (the same as LSL's JSON functions) and are therefore more efficient.
	
	The 'db' macros will do this for you; you should only need these for handling user input.
	
	Occasionally when working with many entries in one section, you may still find it memory-efficient to use the llLinksetData* functions with getjs(). There are no macros for this because you should only be doing it once or twice per program.
