/*
	MODES AND TASK MANAGEMENT
	
	Every program has a bitfield called '_mode' (note the underscore) which defines when the OS will try to put it to sleep. The most common mode flag is MODE_THREADING, which is set automatically while the program has an active task. This should be used whenever the program is waiting for a response from another module, to avoid the 2 second delay of starting back up. Threading jobs will be reset on rez (including sim change, login, attach).
	
	You can begin and end tasks whenever you want.
  
	MODE_NON_VOLATILE is set on programs with '#define NON_VOLATILE' at the top. These programs never go to sleep, and the kernel will not even double-check to make sure they are still flagged as awake when sending them messages. The NON_VOLATILE flag also means the program never gets reset during a rezzing event.
	
	MODE_ACCEPT_DONE means the program will be informed whenever an invoke() or notify() has completed.
