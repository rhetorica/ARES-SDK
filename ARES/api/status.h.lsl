/* status daemon: power loads & updates

   1. create a power load with:
   
   setdbl("chassis", ["load", device + "__" + load_name], (string)wattage);
   
   where 'device' should be 'system' or the address of a connected device, and load_name is a single-word lower-case description of why power is being used
	
   2. trigger the status daemon to reload the status section with:
   
   (from a program) e_call(C_STATUS, E_SIGNAL_CALL, NULL_KEY + " " + NULL_KEY + " status update");
   
   (from a daemon) daemon_to_daemon(E_DAEMON, SIGNAL_CALL, NULL_KEY + " " + NULL_KEY + " status update");

   3. when finished, delete the power load:
   
   deletedbl("chassis", ["load", device + "__" + load_name]);
   
   4. repeat step 2
