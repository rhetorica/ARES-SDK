/*
 * ARES RLV
 *
 * The main role of the effector daemon is in managing RLV restrictions and preventing them from conflicting, similar to an RLV relay. However, there are some slight differences from regular RLV:
 *
 *  - The '@' is stripped off.
 *  - To format _rule_values for restrictions (those rules ending in =n/y/add/rem), put '?' instead. This will be replaced with 'y' and 'n' as appropriate by the effector daemon.
 *  - If a rule's name starts with 'a:' then its contents will be treated as an animation from ring 2 (the daemon ring)
 *  - The new rule 'move=?' causes the system to intercept movement keys while active.
 *  - The rule 'recvchat=?' will also trigger 'recvemote=?' and cause the _input program to attempt to filter quoted text inside emotes.
 *
 * As of Alpha 1, only a few RLV rules can be applied multiple times. These are 'move=?', 'sendchat=?', 'recvemote=?', and 'recvchat=?'. Attempting to remove any other rule will release the restriction entirely, breaking other sources of the same restriction. This will be improved when the RLV relay program 'restraint' is finished in Alpha 3.
